Appendix A      Error Conditions



Most of the error conditions in NCSA Telnet are nonfatal. The 
most important and common error messages are listed here with a 
short summary of the symptoms and causes.

The following messages may appear on your screen during the 
operation of NCSA Telnet. Any other messages that appear are 
protocol-specific messages that require additional diagnosis from 
the system administrator. If a message that is not documented here 
occurs repeatedly, please contact your system administrator first, 
and if no solution is found, submit a bug report as included in the 
Readme and Bugs pages of this manual.


Error in config.tel file

Cause:
NCSA Telnet will not operate without a configuration file that 
contains the PC's IP address. The program could not find this file.

Solution: 
You can place the configuration file either in the current directory 
or specify it with the -h parameter on the command line. You 
normally customize the file's placement in TELNET.BAT. Your 
system administrator should check your installation and make 
sure the configuration file is there.


Host machine not in hosts file

Cause: 
You have entered a machine name that the program can't find in 
the configuration file. 

Solution: 
Check that the name you entered was spelled correctly. If you want 
this computer to be accessed by name, add its name and IP address 
to your configuration file.


ICMP:   Destination unreachable

Cause: 
Another machine––probably the gateway––has determined that 
your message cannot reach its destination from your system.
Solution: 
Check the IP address in your configuration file. Notify your 
system administrator that the gateway cannot connect you to the 
destination you want to reach. A problem may exist with the 
gateway.


ICMP:   Echo requested (ping requested)

Cause: 
Someone has "pinged" your machine.

Solution: 
No action is required; you are just being notified that a program on 
another computer has tried to determine if your machine is alive 
and connected to the network. Your machine answered "yes".


ICMP:   Redirect, another gateway is more efficient

Cause: 
NCSA Telnet is sending packets to a gateway that is reforwarding 
them onto your local network. You will get one of these messages 
for each packet until NCSA Telnet adjusts the local tables and 
automatically switches to the correct gateway.

Solution: 
NCSA Telnet responds to these messages and automatically 
switches to the correct gateway, so you don't have to take any 
action. You may want to change the gateway assignments in your 
configuration file to use a more appropriate gateway.  Some 
situations will always produce redirects.


Local HOST or gateway not responding

Cause: 
Possible reasons this error occurs are: a network problem, a 
configuration file problem, the computer you want to connect to is 
down, or the gateway that you need is down.

Solution: 
If the computer is on your local network, check to see that the 
network is up and running. If the computer is not on your local 
network, check to see if the gateway is up and running. Ask the 
system administrator to check the specification of the gateway 
(gateway=) in your configuration file. Check the IP number of the 
computer that you are trying to connect to. Check to make sure that 
your computer is attached to the network. Check the integrity of the 
network cable.


Memory allocation error, cannot open port

Cause: 
Your system ran out of memory. This reason is the most common 
barrier to opening more sessions.

Solution: 
Log off of some of your sessions or provide more memory in which 
NCSA Telnet can run. Providing more memory may mean 
buying more or rearranging your windowing system to allow 
more memory. NCSA Telnet Version 2.3 requires about 300K of 
memory plus 15K per session. In addition, scrollback requires 86 
bytes per line.


Network jammed, probable break in wire

Cause: 
The PC's Ethernet board could not transmit a packet due to a low-
level hardware error.

Solution: 
The system administrator should ensure that the Ethernet T 
connector or transceiver is correctly connected to the back of your 
PC, then check the integrity of the Ethernet wire according to 
Ethernet specifications. There could be a short circuit in the wire, 
but the usual cause is that the wire has been disconnected 
somewhere.


No internal TCP ports available

Cause: 
You are trying to do too many activities at the same time, or some 
combination of your activities has not closed the TCP sessions 
correctly. This error will happen if you open too many sessions to 
other computers.

Solution: 
Close some of your existing sessions. If necessary, exit the 
program by logging off of all of the other computers, then restart 
NCSA Telnet.


Packet received for invalid port -- reset sent

Cause: 
Some other computer is sending you packets that NCSA Telnet does 
not expect or understand. This error often happens when you press 
CTRL-SHIFT-F3 to exit NCSA Telnet and then try to start it back 
up again. It can happen under a variety of network breakdown 
conditions.

Solution: 
Do not press CTRL-SHIFT-F3 to exit NCSA Telnet. If you already 
have, or some other network breakdown caused the problem, the 
other computer will eventually time out and stop sending you the 
extra packets. If you continue to receive them, notify your system 
administrator.


Reset received: syn sent

Cause: 
The machine to which you are attempting to connect is refusing 
your telnet connection.

Solution: 
Check to see why that machine is not up and running. If it is, check 
your configuration file to see if you are using the correct IP 
number.


Domain Look-up failed for: <machine>

Cause:
The nameservers you've specified in the hosts file are not aware of 
the machine. Also, you may have misspelled a machinename.

Solution:
Check the spelling of the name you've entered. If you've entered 
the name correctly, add that machine to your host configuration 
file. Alternatively, you may want to add another machine as a 
nameserver in your host file.
