Chapter Overview

This chapter introduces NCSA Telnet's capability for multiple 
connections with one or more hosts. The chapter describes 
standard VT100 key emulation, keys for some common EDT 
operations, how to work with multiple sessions, and operations 
with the capture file.


Keyboard Usage

When NCSA Telnet is running, the PC appears to the host as a 
VT100 terminal. For keys that the PC keyboard and the VT100 
keyboard have in common, NCSA Telnet transmits the keystrokes 
unmodified. However, the VT100 keyboard has some keys that the 
PC keyboard does not have, and also treats other PC board keys 
differently. Furthermore, many VT100 keys have special 
meanings when they are transferred to the host. To provide full 
VT100 functionality, telnet programmers have designated some 
PC keys to emulate the operation of VT100 keys. 

Table 2.1 lists the PC keys to use for VT100 terminal emulation.

Multiple Sessions

Opening Multiple Initial 
Sessions
When you first run NCSA Telnet, you can start up multiple 
sessions with a single command.

C:\> telnet machinename [machinename ...]

where machinename is the name of the machine you want to 
connect to. For example, if you enter telnet yoyodyne you would 
be connecting to the machine named yoyodyne.

To start up multiple sessions, enter the additional machinenames 
on the same line. Even if you do not choose multiple sessions when 
you first run NCSA Telnet, you can add sessions later. 


Using the Status Line
Because only 24 lines are needed for VT100 terminal emulation, 
line 25 on your PC screen is used to indicate the connection status 
of your terminal sessions. For each host you are connected to, a 
session name appears in reverse video. The name in the lower-left 
corner of the screen is the current session. Beside each name is a 
status box that indicates various attributes of a session:

gray	Connection is established, waiting
small box	Active connection, always in lower left corner
*	Connection pending, trying to connect to host
/ or \	Text has been written to this invisible session

Flags appear in the lower-right corner if you are either in the 
Scrollback mode or have a capture file open. If you are 
transferring files, the FTP status appears in the lower-right corner 
as well.  Finally, a clock appears in the lower-right corner if you 
enable the clock mode.


Opening Additional 
Sessions
When you've initially opened a connection to a single host, you 
can open a second connection, to that host or a different one, by 
pressing ALT-A (A for add). NCSA Telnet responds by prompting 
you for the name of a computer to which it should attempt a 
connection.

Indicating the Host
NCSA Telnet can only communicate with host computers that have 
IP addresses. You or the NCSA Telnet program can look up IP 
addresses in several different ways.

1.	Use any name that is in the configuration file. (Your system 
administrator can tell you the names listed there.)
2.	Your system administrator can configure NCSA Telnet to use 
the domain-based nameserver to look up host names. Any name 
that can be resolved by the domain nameserver can be used. An 
example is sri-nic.arpa.

3.	Use the full IP number of the machine, in decimal, separated by 
periods, such as 192.17.22.20.If the machine is on the same 
Ethernet,

4.	 If the machine is on the same Ethernet, enter a pound sign (#), 
followed by the host number it uses on your Ethernet. The host 
number the machine determined by the class of addressing and 
the subnet mask (which your system administrator can 
determine for you). For example, if your PC is host 
192.17.22.20, you can access host 192.17.22.30 by entering 
#30 for the host address.

NCSA Telnet allows you to specify which port number (on the host) 
you are connecting to. When you enter the host number, enter a # 
symbol right after the IP number, then enter the port number you 
wish to connect to. For example, if you enter 141.142.221.17#2000, 
this command connects you to the machine 141.142.221.17, port 
number 2000.


Estimating the Host 
Response Time
NCSA Telnet attempts to make a login connection with the named 
host. Usually the connection is instanta-neous, and the host 
machine prompts you for a login name immediately. However, the 
connection attempt may take several seconds. Even after NCSA 
Telnet completes the connection, it may take additional time (up to 
two minutes) to prompt you for a login name if a remote host is 
heavily loaded. 

When the connection is established, the asterisk (*) in the status 
box for the connection disappears or changes to a small box. If 
NCSA Telnet makes the connection, but the remote host does not let 
you log in, you may want to press ALT-X to end the connection.


Using Scrollback Mode
The SCROLL LOCK key performs two functions. It prevents the 
screen from scrolling when new text arrives, and also puts you 
into scrollback mode. In scrollback mode, both the up and down 
arrow keys and PG UP and PG DN keys scroll the screen 
backwards and forwards. When you press the SCROLL LOCK key 
again, it ends scrollback mode and resets the working area of the 
screen. 

The number of lines the program saves is limited by the amount of 
memory in your machine and its setting in the configuration file. 
If your PC runs out of memory, or the specified number of lines 
have already been stored, NCSA Telnet starts dropping the lines at 
the top of the scrollback as you add new lines to the bottom.

NOTE:  No other commands work while you are using scrollback 
mode.


Using the Cut and Paste 
Functions
The cut and paste functions allow you to copy blocks of text from 
one session to another, or within the same session. To use these 
functions, follow these steps:

1.	Enter Scrollback mode via Scrl_Lock or the right mouse button.

2.	Move the cursor to the beginning position of the text you wish to 
copy, and press the space bar.

3.	Move the cursor to the end of the text and press the space bar 
again. This action selects the area to copy. 

4.	Press ALT-C while still in scrollback mode. This action copies 
the text into a buffer.

5.	Exit Scrollback mode, and switch sessions by pressing ALT-N 
or ALT-B, if you desire. 

6.	Position the cursor where you wish to insert the text, and press 
ALT-V. This action inserts the text at the current position as if 
you had typed it in.

You can use the copy and paste functions without touching the 
keyboard if you have a Microsoft-compatible mouse attached and 
driver loaded. 

1.	Press the right mouse button to enter Scrollback mode. 

2.	Scroll to the beginning of the text you wish to copy, and press the 
left mouse button. 

3.	Move the cursor to the end of the text, and press the left mouse 
button again. 

4.	Press and hold the left mouse button, press the right mouse 
button, then release both buttons. This action copies the text into 
the buffer. 

5.	Exit Scrollback mode by pressing the right mouse button. 

To paste the buffer to the screen, press and hold the right mouse 
button, then press the left mouse button, then release them both. The 
text should appear as if you typed it in.


Switching Between 
Sessions (ALT-N)
The status line at the bottom of the screen indicates the active telnet 
sessions. To rotate to the next session, press ALT-N (for next). 
This action makes the next session the current one and moves its 
name to the lower left corner of the screen. Any characters you now 
type on the keyboard are sent to this, the current session.

To move back one session, press ALT-B (for back).


Displaying Console 
Messages (ALT-Z)
In the process of connecting and communicating with other hosts 
via TCP/IP, NCSA Telnet provides you with information on the 
console (message) screen. To see this screen, press ALT-Z. Your 
sessions are still running; however, you cannot see them. When 
you have viewed the messages, press any key to return to your 
session. The information on the console screen can tell you about 
errors, warnings, FTP access to your PC, and network conditions 
that may be of concern to network administrators.


Exiting the Present 
Connection (ALT-X)
To close the current session, press ALT-X. A dialog box appears 
prompting you to confirm that the connection should be closed. 
Once confirmed, the connection shuts down.  The close may take 
several seconds to complete.  

NOTE:  You can press ALT-X to log out of a host as well as 
terminate a given session, but the command bypasses normal 
conventions and may cause problems for the host. The correct way 
to close a connection with a host is to log out of the host using the 
normal logout procedure for that host. 


Capture File Operations 

Text that appears on the screen can be captured and sent to a file or 
the local printer. When you press ALT-C, capture is turned on. 
Pressing ALT-C again toggles capture off. Any text that appears on 
the screen is captured and appended to the capture file. NCSA 
Telnet never erases the capture file, only appends text to it. The 
default capture file is named capfile, but you can change that, as 
discussed in the next session.


Designating a Capture File
You can designate a different capture file by using the Parameter 
menu. When you press ALT-P the Parameter menu appears. (Most 
of the Parameter menu choices are discussed in Chapter 3, "More 
About Managing Sessions.") Use the arrow keys to select the 
Parameter menu entry for the capture filename. Press RETURN 
to clear the current entry and then enter your new filename. After 
you've changed the name of the capture file, all subsequent ALT-C 
commands will use the new capture file. You can also change the 
name of the capture file "permanently" in the configuration file 
(see Chapter 6, "Installation and Configuration.").


Using PRN
If you want to send all captured text directly to a local printer, 
follow the directions above for naming new filenames. Enter prn 
as the new filename. This name is the default filename for 
printing in the NCSA Telnet program. PC-DOS reserves this 
filename for the printer.

A common problem can occur while you are capturing files to the 
printer that can cause NCSA Telnet to abort. If the printer is off-
line or out of paper when a capture begins, the message:

Error, A(bort) R(etry) or I(gnore)? 

appears on the screen. For the former problem, turn the printer on 
and off and then press R for retry. Do not press A at this point 
because it will abort NCSA Telnet and cut off all of your network 
connections.


Using One Capture at a 
Time
You can capture text to a file or the printer in any session, but not 
for more than one session at a time. When a capture is active for a 
session in the background, you cannot invoke capture on the 
current session. If you attempt to do so, you will not get the 
confirmation message on line 25 and NCSA Telnet reminds you of 
the error. The capture procedure will continue to capture all text for 
the background session while you interact with the current 
session.

If you press ALT-D, NCSA Telnet dumps the contents of the current 
session screen into the capture file if one is not already open. If a 
capture file is open, nothing happens when you press ALT-D.

NOTE:  If you press ALT-D, NCSA Telnet dumps only the contents 
of the current session screen into the capture file. If you press ALT-
C, however, NCSA dumps everything from your current session 
into the capture file.
