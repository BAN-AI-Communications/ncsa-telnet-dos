Chapter Overview

This chapter introduces and describes the basic steps involved in 
using NCSA Telnet for the IBM PC:

¥       starting the program
¥       setting the terminal type
¥       opening and closing a telnet connection

The chapter assumes that your system or network administrator 
has installed NCSA Telnet on your system, assigned an IP 
address to your IBM PC, and given you a login name and password 
for the computer to which you want to connect. For information 
regarding installation and customization procedures, refer to 
Chapter 7, "Installation and Configuration."

If you require additional information regarding the IBM interface 
or command line structure, please refer to your IBM PC user's 
guide.


Starting the Program 

To run NCSA Telnet from the PC command line, from any 
subdirectory, enter:

C:\ > telnet machinename 

This command initiates a connection to the remote computer with 
the name given as the machinename parameter. Normally the 
host machine immediately prompts you for a login name and 
password to begin the session.

NCSA Telnet emulates a VT100 terminal. When you log in to a 
host, the host operating system does not know what type of terminal 
you are using. Consult the operating system manual for how to set 
terminal type and try setting it to VT100 or VT102. For systems that 
do not support VT100 (such as many UNIX systems), use VT100, 
which is compatible with VT102 emulators. These examples show 
how to set the terminal type for two popular operating systems, 
UNIX (using the C shell) and VAX/VMS.

newton% set term=vt100;tset     For UNIX hosts.

B$ SET TERM/INQ                 For VAX/VMS hosts.

Using the Help Screen

Press ESC for information page, space bar to return to session:


NOTE:  See Chapter 4, "Utility Programs," for information on 
other network utilities, such as the following:  finger, ftp, lpq, lpr, 
lprm, rexec, and set clock.


Quitting NCSA Telnet

To exit the program, log out of the host machine using the 
appropriate logout procedure for that machine. If you have 
concurrent sessions with more than one machine, you must log out 
of each machine. Then NCSA Telnet exits and the DOS prompt is 
displayed.

If one of the hosts crashes, or a session is otherwise hung up, press 
ALT-X. NCSA Telnet first prompts you for confirmation and then 
attempts to close the session while preserving your other live 
sessions. 

When all else fails, and it appears that all of the connections are 
completely jammed, press CTRL-Shift-F3 to abort the program. 
Only use CTRL-Shift-F3 as a last resort.

Pressing CTRL-C or CTRL-BREAK sends a CTRL-C to the host. 
You can neither use these commands to break out of NCSA Telnet, 
nor end your session.
