Overview

This introduction presents an overview of the capabilities and 
features of NCSA Telnet. The organization and use of this manual 
are described and notational conventions explained.


About NCSA Telnet

NCSA Telnet Version 2.3 for the PC provides interactive access 
from an IBM PC or compatible to telnet hosts on TCP/IP networks. 
NCSA Telnet is an implementation of DARPA standard telnet 
with added features that take advantage of the local processing 
power of the PC.


Special Features

Special features of NCSA Telnet for the PC include:

¥	VT100 emulation
¥	Local printer support for VT100 emulation
¥	Simultaneous logon to a number of computers
¥	Ability to capture text to the PC disk or printer
¥	File transfer server (standard FTP)
¥	Remote copy server (rcp) for use with UNIX hosts
¥	Ability to take full advantage of PC colors
¥	Topview/Windows compatibility
¥	Tektronix 4014 emulation
¥	Added applications such as:  lpr, lpq, lprm, rexec, rsh, finger, 
setclock (all similar to UNIX utilities)
¥	Domain name lookup
¥	Optional use of RARP and Bootp for determining PC's IP 
address 
¥	Support for Linemode protocol
¥	Scrollback with mouse support
¥	Cut and paste capabilities for text between sessions
¥	Keyboard mapping
¥	Text output mapping
¥	Better message routing of telnet options to console screen
¥	Ability to dump screens to a capture file


 System Requirements

To use NCSA Telnet you must have the following hardware:

¥	IBM PC, PC/XT, PC/AT, IBM PS/2 model 30, or "true" 
compatible computer with one of the following Ethernet adapter 
boards:

	Appletalk Card
	DecNet Card
	3COM 3C501 Etherlink 
	3COM 3C503
	3COM 3C505
	AT&T Starlan 10
	Western Digital WD8003EB
	MICOM NI5210 
	Ungermann-Bass PC-NIC (same as IBM Baseband Adapter)
	Western Digital WD8003E EtherCard PLUS

¥	or IBM PS/2 models 50,60 or 80, or "true" compatible computer 
with one of the following Ethernet adapter boards:

	Ungermann-Bass NICps/2
	3COM 3C523 Etherlink/MC
	Western Digital WD8003A

¥	The following adapters have been tested successfully with 
packet drivers:

	3Com's 3C501, 3C503, 3C505, 3C507, and 3C523
	Any SMC-mode ARCnet card
	Any AT&T Ethernet or StarLAN card
	D-Link Systems' DE-600 Pocket LAN Adapter
	Simulated driver over NetWare's IPX

	Apple Computer's LocalTalk PC Card
	Sun/TOPS (Sitka) FlashCard
	Simulated driver over NetBIOS
	NCR's ET-105B
	Novell's NE1000, NE2000, and clones
	Racal-InterLan's NI5010, NI5210, NI6510, and NI9210
	Ungermann-Bass's NIC and NICps/2
	All Western Digital's models

¥	384K minimum memory

¥	Ethernet or Thin Ethernet to connect the PC and other computers

To use NCSA Telnet you must have the following software:

¥	PC-DOS or MS-DOS Version 2.0 or later
¥	a standard text editor (helpful when editing the configuration 
file)


Use of This Manual

This section describes the organization of this manual, and the 
conventions and nomenclature used in developing it.


Manual Contents
This manual is organized into the following chapters:

Chapter 1, "Starting and Quitting NCSA Telnet," describes how to 
start NCSA Telnet and how to open and close a connection between 
your PC and one remote host.

Chapter 2, "Introduction to Managing Sessions," introduces NCSA 
Telnet's capability for multiple connections. It also discusses 
standard VT100 key emulation, keys used for common EDT 
operations, and usage of a capture file.

Chapter 3, "More about Managing Sessions," discusses multiple 
sessions in detail. The Parameters menu options, DOS shell 
feature, and several advanced functions are also described.

Chapter 4, "Utility Programs," outlines in detail some helpful 
command programs which you can implement along with NCSA 
Telnet.

Chapter 5, "File Transfer," outlines procedures for transferring 
files between a PC and a telnet host.

Chapter 6, "Tektronix 4014 Emulation," discusses NCSA Telnet's 
ability to emulate a Tektronix 4014 graphics terminal.

Chapter 7, "Installation and Configuration," contains 
information for system administrators (and other experienced 
users) to use when installing and customizing a system.

Appendix A, "Error Conditions," describes some of NCSA Telnet's 
error messages, as well as their causes and solutions.

Appendix B, "NCSA Telnet Command Reference," lists 
commands available from the PC keyboard.

Appendix C, "Configuration File Summary," lists the keywords 
for configuration file parameters.

Appendix D, "FTPBIN Command Reference," describes the 
FTPBIN commands that the program uses.
Appendix E, "Key-mapping," details the key-mapping elements 
NCSA Telnet for the PC incorporates from the MS-Kermit 
program.

Appendix F, "Obtaining NCSA Software," outlines the procedures 
for obtaining NCSA software via FTP, an archive server, or U.S. 
mail.

	wording of the response will vary, depending 
	on the filename, machinename, and so on.

...	Do not enter an ellipsis. The ellipsis 
	indicates that you may enter more material 
	similar to the material preceding the ellipsis.
