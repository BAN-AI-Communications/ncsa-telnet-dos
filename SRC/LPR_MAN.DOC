            Introduction

            These utilities  allow access to printers attached to remote
            computer  systems   via  a   TCP/IP  network.     They   are
            implementations of the like named Unix utilities.


            Things You Will Need

            You will  need to have access to a computer that will accept
            print jobs from you.  It must be accessible from the network
            and support the Berkeley Line Printer protocol (available on
            most Unix systems).

            Your computer  must  have  a  suitable  network  connection.
            Either

               1 An Ethernet connection with one of the supported
                 adapter boards.  For an IBM PC, XT, AT, PS/2 model 30,
                 or compatible, the supported ethernet adapter boards
                 are:
                   y  3COM 3C501 Etherlink
                   y  MICOM NI5210
                   y  Ungermann-Bass PC-NIC
                   y  Western Digital WD8003E

                 For IBM PS/2 models, 50, 60, 70, or 80, or compatible,
                 the supported boards are:
                   y  Ungermann-Bass NICps/2
                   y  3COM 3C523 Etherlink/MC

               2 A hard-wired serial port supporting the SLIP protocol.
                 A serial connection is slower than an Ethernet
                 connection, but may still be adequate.


            Getting Started

            The software is available by anonymous FTP from mtsg.ubc.ca.
            Use binary  mode to  get  the  file  LP.EXE  from  the  PC1:
            directory.



            Instructions on  how to  install these  utilities are in the
            appendix.

                                  Printing a File


            To print  a file, enter the lpr command followed by the name
            of the  file.   For  example,  if  you  had  a  file  called
            readme.txt that you wanted to print, you would use

                 lpr readme.txt

            If all goes well, the file will be sent over the network and
            then printed.   When  lpr has  finished sending the file, it
            reports done and returns to the DOS prompt.

            Printing multiple copies

            You can print more than one copy of a file by specifying the
            -# option.  For example:

                 lpr -#3 readme.txt

            will produce  three copies  of readme.txt.   Note  that  the
            remote computer  you are  sending your  print files  to  may
            impose limits on how many copies you can produce.

            Printing files with page breaks and page titles

            To have  your document broken up into pages and printed with
            page titles, use the -p option.  For example:

                 lpr -p readme.txt

            In this  example, each  page would  have readme.txt  as  the
            title.   If you  want a  title other than the file name, use
            the -T option.  For example:

                 lpr -p -T top_secret sdi.doc

            The pages  would be titled with top_secret.  Note that there
            must not  be any spaces within your title.  The -T option is
            only of use in combination with the -p option.

            You can  also specify  the page  width to  use with  the  -w
            option.  For example:

                 lpr -p -w72 readme.txt

            will format the text into lines of up to 72 characters.  The
            -w option only works in combination with the -p option.

            Indenting

            To have  your output  shifted away from the left margin, use
            the -i option.  For example:

                 lpr -i readme.txt



            The printout  will be  shifted to the right by eight spaces.
            For different  indents, you can specify the number of spaces
            to use:

                 lpr -i4 readme.txt

            will indent  by four  spaces.   There must  not be  a  space
            between the -i and the number.

            Printing TeX

            If you  use the TeX text processing package, you can use lpr
            to print  your .DVI  files.   To do  so, you must use the -d
            option.  For example:

                 lpr -d sample.dvi

            The remote  computer that is doing your printing for you may
            or may not be able to print DVI files; check with the system
            administrator to  find out.  Note also that there will be no
            opportunity for  you to  do a font substitution when the DVI
            file is  interpreted, so you must not use any fonts that are
            not available on the printer.

            Printing PostScript

            If the  printer you will be using understands PostScript, it
            should automatically  recognize the  `%!' signature found at
            the start of most PostScript files and print them correctly.
            You don't need to specify any formatting options.

            Printing several files

            You can  print more  than one  file at  a time; just include
            each file name with the lpr command.  For example:

                 lpr -p c:\autoexec.bat c:\config.sys -d -#2 thesis.dvi

            As you  can see  in the example, you can intermix formatting
            options in  with the  files to  be printed.  The options and
            file names  are processed  from left  to right.    Whichever
            formatting options  are currently in effect when lpr finds a
            file name are the ones that are used for that file.  Once an
            option has  been set,  it remains in effect until changed or
            over-ridden by another option.

            Using a different printer

            Your output  is normally  sent to  the printer identified by
            the PRINTER  and SERVER environment variables (see part 4 of
            the appendix).  You can use a different printer and/or print
            server by  giving the  -P and/or  -S options.  The -P option
            changes the  name of  the printer  to use.   The  -S  option
            changes the  address of  the print  server computer  to use.
            For example:

                 lpr -P LW-407 -S havarti lp.doc



            output will be sent to the printer called LW-407 attached to
            the computer called havarti.

            When you  use the -P and -S options, they apply only to that
            command.     They  don't   change  the  PRINTER  and  SERVER
            environment  variables.     If   the  PRINTER   and   SERVER
            environment variables have not been set, you must use the -P
            and -S options.

            Miscellaneous options

            Print jobs  are normally  separated by  a `burst page' which
            identifies the  owner of  the output.   Printed on the burst
            page are  the job  classification and the job name.  The job
            classification defaults to your machine name unless set with
            the -C  option.   The job  name defaults  to the name of the
            file being  printed unless  set with  the -J  option.    For
            example:

                 lpr -C my_output -J beaujolais wine.lst

            The job  classification and  job name  must not  contain any
            spaces.   If a  burst page is not necessary, you can use the
            -h option to prevent it from being printed.

            The -f  option is  used if  the your  file is formatted with
            FORTRAN  carriage  control  characters.    FORTRAN  carriage
            control is seldom used on micro-computers.

            The -l  option is  used if  your file  contains non-printing
            control characters that the printer can understand.




                       Checking the Status of Your Print Jobs


            Since several people may want to use the same printer at the
            same time,  and each job may take a length of time to print,
            a  job  that  you  send  may  not  be  printed  immediately.
            Instead, it may have to wait in a queue until the printer is
            available.   To find  out if  your output  has been printed,
            enter the  lpq command.  The remote computer will be queried
            and the  status  of  the  jobs  it  is  processing  will  be
            displayed.  For example,

                 lpq
                 Owner  Files      Job#   Job Name  Status         Size
                 kent   champagne  34702  caviar    Printing       19192
                 sue    smongo.c   31241  smongo.c  Printed        27182
                 paul   games.txt  34789  games     Awaiting Print 84456

            As you  can see  in the example, the status display includes
            other peoples'  jobs. To check the status of your jobs only,
            add your name to the lpq command:

                 lpq paul

            Only jobs owned by the user paul would be displayed.

            Periodic update

            To have  the status  display updated  every few seconds, use
            the + option:

                 lpq +

            The status  will be  displayed and  then refreshed every few
            seconds.   To stop  the  display,  press  any  key  on  your
            keyboard.  It will stop automatically when there are no jobs
            to report on.  You can also set a particular delay interval:

                 lpq +5

            will wait five seconds between display refreshes.

            Using a different printer

            As with  the lpr  command, lpq  normally  uses  the  printer
            identified by  the PRINTER  and SERVER environment variables
            (see part  4 of the appendix), but you can use the -P and -S
            options to  select a different printer.  lpq only checks the
            queue for the printer selected.




                                 Cancelling Output


            If you  change your  mind after sending a file for printing,
            but before  it has  actually been printed, you can cancel it
            with the lprm command.  For example:

                 lprm 34789

            would cancel  job 34789.   The  job number  (34789  in  this
            example) is  assigned when you submit the file for printing,
            and can  be obtained with the lpq command (described above).
            You can only cancel your own jobs.

            If you  want to  cancel all  of your  jobs that are awaiting
            print, use the - option in place of the job number:

                 lprm -

            would cancel any of your jobs that had not yet been printed.
            lprm will report the names of any files it removes.

            Using a different printer

            As with  the lpr  and lpq  commands, lprm  normally uses the
            printer identified  by the  PRINTER and  SERVER  environment
            variables, but you can use the -P and -S options to select a
            different printer.




                             Appendix A - Installation


            These installation  instructions assume  you have a moderate
            amount of  technical knowledge  of PC's,  MS-DOS, and  local
            area networks.   You  should have  correctly configured  and
            installed your  Ethernet adapter before beginning with these
            instructions.

            1. Unpack archive file

            LP.EXE is  a self-extracting  archive of  the files you will
            need.  Simply enter LP to extract the files:
                   lpr.exe      - program for printing files
                   lpq.exe      - program to check on print status
                   lprm.exe     - program to cancel a print job
                   config.tel   - network configuration file
                   slip8250.com - packet driver for serial port
                   manual.doc   - this manual
                   manual.ps    - this manual, in PostScript

            After unpacking  the archive,  you will  want  to  move  the
            lpr.exe, lpq.exe,  and lprm.exe  files to  a directory along
            your search path.

            2. Install SLIP packet driver

            If you  do not  have an  Ethernet connection, but do have an
            asynchronous serial  port connection that supports SLIP (the
            serial line  internet protocol),  you  can  still  use  this
            software.   You will,  however, have  to  install  an  extra
            program called  a packet  driver.    If  you  are  using  an
            Ethernet connection, skip this section.

            The packet  driver you  need  to  install  is  in  the  file
            slip8250.com.   It is  a Terminate  and Stay  Resident (TSR)
            type program; running the program will install it.  You will
            want to  run the  program from within your autoexec.bat file
            so it  is loaded every time you re-boot your machine.  To do
            so,

               1 Copy the slip8250.com file to a directory in your
                 search path.

               2 Choose an available interrupt number in the range 0x60
                 to 0x7f.  On most machines, interrupt 0x60 is probably
                 available and can be used.

               3 Determine which serial port (COM1 or COM2) you are
                 going to use and at what baud rate.

               4 The command to install the packet driver is of the form

                      slip8250 <interrupt number> slip <irq number>
                                <port address> <baud rate>



                 If you are using serial port COM1, the correct values
                 for <irq number> and <port address> are 4 and 0x3F8.
                 For COM2, the correct values are 3 and 0x2F8.  For
                 example, to install the packet driver using COM1 at
                 9600 baud, you would add the line

                 slip8250 0x60 slip 4 0x3f8 9600

                 to your autoexec.bat file.

            After you  have added  this line  to your autoexec.bat file,
            you must re-boot your machine to have it take effect.

            3. Modify configuration file

            If you  use the  NCSA Telnet program on your PC, you already
            have a  config.tel file  and should  use that instead of the
            one unpacked from the archive.  The only change you may need
            to make is to define the `myname' entry, which specifies the
            name that  your machine  is known  by.   Once you  have done
            that, skip to section 4.

            If you  do not  already have  them, obtain  an IP address, a
            subnet mask,   and  a name  for your machine from your local
            network administrator.

            Next,  edit   the  config.tel  file  to  reflect  the  above
            information, and  also the  type and  configuration of  your
            network connection.   Only  seven  of  the  entries  in  the
            config.tel file are essential:

                 myname=fred.phys.ubc.ca
                      Your machine  must have  a name  that it  is to be
                      known  by.     Check   with  your   local  network
                      administrator to find a suitable name.

                 myip=128.189.123.456
                      Your machine must have a unique address.  Using an
                      incorrect address  can cause  problems  for  other
                      people on  the network,  so be  careful.  See your
                      local network administrator if you need help.

                 netmask=255.255.0.0
                      Again, see your network administrator.

                 hardware=wd8003
                      This entry identifies the type of Ethernet adapter
                      you have, or if you are using a packet driver.
                      
                      Value     Ethernet Board           Requires
                      3C501     3COM 3C501 Etherlink     interrupt,
                      ioaddr

                      3C523     3COM 3C523 Etherlink/MC  address, ioaddr
                      packet    FTP packet driver        address, ioaddr
                      
                      Depending on  the Ethernet  adapter type,  you may
                      need to  set the  interrupt, ioaddr,  and  address
                      entries as indicated above.

                 interrupt=5
                      The hardware  interrupt vector  number  that  your
                      Ethernet adapter was configured for (Only required
                      for 3C501 adapter).

                 address=d000
                      The segment address of the Ethernet board's shared
                      memory, entered  as four  hexadecimal digits.  Set
                      to  the   value  that  your  Ethernet  adapter  is
                      configured for.   If you are using a packet driver
                      interface, set to 0.

                 ioaddr=360
                      The I/O  base address  of the  Ethernet  board  in
                      hexadecimal.   Set to the value that your Ethernet
                      adapter is  configured for.   If  you are  using a
                      packet driver  interface,  set  to  the  interrupt
                      number (do not include the 0x prefix).

            Edit your  autoexec.bat file  to  the  set  the  environment
            variable CONFIG.TEL  to be  the location  of your  config.tel
            file.  For example:

                 set configtel=c:\utility\config.tel

            Complete documentation  on the  configuration  file  can  be
            found in  chapter 6 of NCSA Telnet for the PC, Version 2.2TN
            and Version 2.2D.

            4. Set up a default printer and server

            In order to use these utilities you need to specify the name
            or address  of a  print server,  the computer  that receives
            files from  you and  prints them.   Since a print server may
            have several  printers attached  to it,  you  also  need  to
            specify the  name of  the printer that you want to use.  You
            obtain this information from the system administrator of the
            machine that is to be your print server.

            You could give the printer name and server address each time
            you use  one of  the printing  utilities, but  it is usually
            more convenient  to put  them  in  the  PRINTER  and  SERVER
            environment variables.   The SERVER environment variable, if
            defined, gives  the name  or Internet  address of  the print
            server to  use.   The PRINTER environment variable gives the
            name of  the printer  on the  server machine  that is  to be
            used.   You will probably want to set the PRINTER and SERVER
            variables to suitable values in your autoexec.bat file.  For
            example:



                 set printer=cntr
                 set server=128.189.103.1

            If you  later have  a  file  that  you  want  printed  on  a
            different printer,  you can either set PRINTER and/or SERVER
            to that  printer, or  use the  -P and/or -S options with the
            lpr, lpq, and lprm commands.




                    Appendix B - Notes for System Administrators


            These notes  are directed  to the  administrator of  a  Unix
            system who  wishes to  allow use  of the  system as  a print
            server.   They briefly  describe the  steps needed under Sun
            OS, but  other Unix  systems should  be similar.  You should
            also refer  to sections  12.3 (etc/hosts),  19.4 (hosts.lpd)
            and chapter  22 (name  server) of the SunOS System & Network
            Administration manual.

            The first  step is  to add  entries in  the LPD access file,
            /etc/hosts.lpd, for  the machines  that are  to have access.
            Edit the  file and insert the names of the machines, one per
            line.   Note that  an IP  address is  not acceptable, so all
            microcomputers that  are to  have access  must be assigned a
            name.

            The second  step is  to add entries to either the /etc/hosts
            file (if  you are  not using a domain name server) or to the
            name server  database (if  you are  using  a  name  server).
            Entries in  the /etc/hosts  file consist of IP addresses and
            names, one entry per line.

            If you are using a name server, list your named.boot file to
            find out  what the  relevant hosts  and rev.hosts  files are
            called.   Next, edit  those files,  being sure to update the
            serial numbers  at the  start of  them.  To make the changes
            take effect, use the Unix command:

                 kill -HUP `cat /etc/named.pid`

            This will cause the name server daemon to re-read the files.
