Here at NCSA, we have had a lot of questions on how to correctly install
packet drivers.  Most of the questions occur because people have failed
to recognize that the PACKET DRIVERS PARAMETERS ARE ASSUMED TO BE IN DECIMAL.
Below is an example on installing the 3C501 packet driver.  The other drivers
are installed in a similar fashion.

The packet driver usage for the 3C501 is:
        3C501 <packet_int_no> <int_no> <io_addr>

I want to install the packet driver at software interrupt 60h (hex).
The relationship between the settings and packet driver parameters is:

Setting                           |               Parameter 
----------------------------------+------------------------------------
HARDWARE INTERRUPT=3h (hex)       |               <int_no>
BASE IO ADDRESS=360h (hex)        |               <io_addr>
SHARED MEMORY ADDRESS=d800h (hex) |               <base_addr>
SOFTWARE INTERRUPT 60h (hex)      |               <packet_int_no> 


Note the Ethernet card uses a hardware interrupt while the packet driver
uses a software interrupt.

The 3C501 packet drivers needs the software interrupt, hardware interrupt, 
and base io address.  It does NOT need the shared memory address.  Also note 
that each of the parameters are hex numbers, not decimal numbers.  If 
decimal numbers are going to be used the hex numbers need to be converted
to decimal.  

To install the driver with the above settings, the following is entered 
at the DOS command line:

3C501 0x60 0x3 0x360

Note the "0x" in front of each parameter signifies a hex number.  
To use decimal numbers, the following would have been entered:

3C501 96 3 864

The hex numbers were converted to decimal and then used.

required by each packet driver, refer to "drivers.doc" file.
